1. To write to a file using a node.js you simple type, one of node.js core modules as below
-require('fs')
2.Store the simple file functionality in a variable
- const fs = require('fs')
3. Use the variable (fs) which is the file system saved into it to call
-writeFileSync(''), which is a method made available by the file system object which we are importing .The method will write a file
to our hard drive
4. The argument it want is the path to the file ,including the file name and second argument is the content of the the fle
- fs.writeFileSync('hello.txt','hello Ghana people')

EXAMPLE
-----
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFileSync('hello.txt','Ghana is for us all');
5. WE use Node.js to write server-side code
- User using browser (client)
- We use html +css _ JS script in the browser
- First send a request using url
- A server some using the internet with IP associated with domain
- On server code is executed that does something with the incoming request and response is sent back in html,css,js file back to the user#
- On server we don't do stuffs which we wouldnt want to do in the browser because security and performance reasons
a. Database
b.authentication
c.input validation
d. Your business Logic


6. Node.js is not typically limited to running code on a server, it's a js runtime
-you may not always need a browser
-you may not always need a server to use node.js

9. it is a great utility script (having access to file to manipulating stuffs)
- Use in context of web development and server side code
- run a server
- It is not just used to run a code that run on the server but also can be used to write the server
- example a code that takes incoming request and write them to your other codes.
-Node.js does listening
RUN SERVER
----------
Create server and listen to incoming requests

Business Logic
-------------
Handle request ,validate input ,connection to database

RESPONSE
-----------
rETURN RESPONSES (HTML,JSON,...) BACK TO THE CLIENT (BROWSER)

11. TWO Ways of executing node code
-REPL
------
R- Read (userInput)
E -evalUate (userInput)
P - Print Output (Result)
L -Loop (Wait for new input)

Note: In your terminal , type (node) to allow you perform all coding in the repl
example: 1+ 1, you can also write to a file ,etc

-quit using (ctrl + c)

- for playgrounds

b. The second way is
-----------------------
-using files
-for real apps
Predictable sequence of steps

13. JS IS
-weakly typed of language
a. No explicit type of assignment (knows types like numbers,text called string or booleans being ture or false,
you are not forced to define the variable type.

b. DataTypes can be switched dynamically

- Object-Oriented langugae
a. Data can be organised in logicall objects
b primitive and reference types

- Versatile language
a. Runs in browser and directly on a PC/Server
b. can perform a broad variety of tasks
