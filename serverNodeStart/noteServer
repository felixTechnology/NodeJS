1. Creating a server through nodejs
-we executed that file (serverNodeStart/app.js) with node js
-it started a script where node.js went through the entire file
-it parsed the code
- registered the variables and functions and so on

2. Core module (http, https, fs, path, os)
3. Request listener isa function that will execute for every incoming request
4.Event loop process is a process managed by node.js which keeps on running as long as there is work to do
-as long as there are event listeners registered and one event listener we did register
-and we never unregistered ,is that imcoming request listener we passed or we set up with the help of create server
-we passed a function to create server
-that is basically an ongoing event listener, one we didnt unregister from and we shouldnt because our server should of course stau up

4. Our core node application basically is managed by this event loop, all our code is managed by this
-node.js uses event driven approach for all kinds of stuff
- not just for managing a server

3. webserver that does different things depending on which route we enter
- Load a page where USER can enter some data which will be stored in a file on the server once it is sent
-We can do that by 1st passing the url. Store it in a new constant
-Do it by accessing  request url (req.url) example (/test)
-Add if statement , and check if the url is equal to just slash and only this will match .That is: if(url === '/'){}
-inside the block curly bracket write the html with the head, title,body, form,button, add action in your form tag (action='/message')
- When we click on SEND button, we send a Post request to (/message) but we are not doing that in our previous code
